# YNews
This repository contains the code for YNews. <br/>YNews is an app that is focused on UX by enabling users to read, store and share articles with ease.

## Introduction
After creating my previous application WaTaCook in Java and experiencing nefarious bugs, I decided to create a new application using AAC and clean architecture via MVVM. Surprisingly, this led to fewer bugs.
Examples of some skills learnt in order to make this project include **Coroutines**, **Dagger Hilt**, **Paging 3** and **Android Repository Pattern**.

## Updates
Future features include (but is not limited to):
- automatic cache with WorkManager (v1.1.0)
- app intro setup (v2.0.0)
- article recommendations with AI (v?.0.0)

## Downloads
This will be uploaded onto the PlayStore after v2.0.0 is stable
